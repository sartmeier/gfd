transcript_support_level	{1,2,3,4,5,NA} [0,1] transcripts are scored according to how well mRNA and EST alignments match over its full length: 1 (all splice junctions of the transcript are supported by at least one non-suspect mRNA), 2 (the best supporting mRNA is flagged as suspect or the support is from multiple ESTs), 3 (the only support is from a single EST), 4 (the best supporting EST is flagged as suspect), 5 (no single transcript supports the model structure), NA (the transcript was not analyzed)
