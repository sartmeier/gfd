appris_principal_1,(This flag corresponds to the older flag "appris_principal") Where the transcript expected to code for the main functional isoform based solely on the core modules in the APPRIS database. The APPRIS core modules map protein structural and functional information and cross-species conservation to the annotated variants.
appris_principal_2,(This flag corresponds to the older flag "appris_candidate_ccds") Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant (approximately 25% of human protein coding genes), the database chooses two or more of the CDS variants as "candidates" to be the principal variant. If one (but no more than one) of these candidates has a distinct CCDS identifier it is selected as the principal variant for that gene. A CCDS identifier shows that there is consensus between RefSeq and GENCODE/Ensembl for that variant, guaranteeing that the variant has cDNA support.
appris_principal_3,Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and there more than one of the variants have distinct CCDS identifiers, APPRIS selects the variant with lowest CCDS identifier as the principal variant. The lower the CCDS identifier, the earlier it was annotated. Consensus CDS annotated earlier are likely to have more cDNA evidence. Consecutive CCDS identifiers are not included in this flag, since they will have been annotated in the same release of CCDS. These are distinguished with the next flag.
appris_principal_4,(This flag corresponds to the Ensembl 78 flag "appris_candidate_longest_ccds") Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal CDS and there is more than one variant with a distinct (but consecutive) CCDS identifiers, APPRIS selects the longest CCDS isoform as the principal variant.
appris_principal_5,(This flag corresponds to the Ensembl 78 flag "appris_candidate_longest_seq") Where the APPRIS core modules are unable to choose a clear principal variant and none of the candidate variants are annotated by CCDS, APPRIS selects the longest of the candidate isoforms as the principal variant.

appris_candidate_longest_ccds,the "appris_candidate" transcripts where there are several CCDS, in this case APPRIS labels the longest CCDS.

fragmented_locus,locus consists of non-overlapping transcript fragments either because of genome assembly issues (i.e., gaps or mis-assemblies), or because supporting transcripts (e.g., from another species) cannot be completely mapped, or because the supporting transcripts are non-overlapping end pairs (i.e., 5' and 3' ESTs from a single cDNA).
inferred_exon_combination,transcript model contains all possible in-frame exons supported by homology, experimental evidence or conservation, but the exon combination is not directly supported by a single piece of evidence and may not be biological. Used for large genes with repetitive exons (e.g. titin (TTN)) to represent all the exons individual transcript variants can pool from.
inferred_transcript_model,transcript model is not supported by a single piece of transcript evidence. May be supported by multiple fragments of transcript evidence or by combining different evidence sources e.g. protein homology, RNA-seq data, published experimental data.

MANE_Select,the transcript belongs to the MANE Select data set. The Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI project (MANE) is a collaboration between Ensembl-GENCODE and RefSeq to select a default transcript per human protein coding locus that is representative of biology, well-supported, expressed and conserved. This transcript set matches GRCh38 and is 100% identical between RefSeq and Ensembl-GENCODE for 5' UTR, CDS, splicing and 3' UTR.
MANE_Plus_Clinical,the transcript belongs to the MANE Plus Clinical data set. Within the MANE project, these are additional transcripts per locus necessary to support clinical variant reporting, for example transcripts containing known pathogenic or likely pathogenic clinical variants not reportable using the MANE Select data set. This transcript set matches GRCh38 and is 100% identical between RefSeq and Ensembl-GENCODE for 5' UTR, CDS, splicing and 3' UTR.
